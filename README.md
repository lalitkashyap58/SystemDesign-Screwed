# Suppose you have a pizza Shop
  -- Now what you will do to server more customers?<br/>
      -- the answer is :  -> you ask your chef to do more hardwork with more pay. **this concept is called vertical scaling**.<br/>
                          -> you ask him to prepare during off hours ---> but what is cook got fever ðŸ¤’=>  hiring a backup chef is the optimal solution **This is called Master Slave Architecture**<br/>
                          -> you hire more chefs on realising that  two persons can serve better ( **this is called Horizontal scaling**)<br/>
                          -> now you decide to make seperate sections for pizzas , cold drinks , buns and other stuff. ( **This is called Microservice**).<br/>
                          -> Now you make two shops , serving the pizzas in the city , customer orders the pizza , How you will decide where to place order , I mean from which shop **Load Balancer will decide**
